Modul 1
Exercises/Tasks:

Create a GitHub repository to host the MLOps course project and make sure that all team members have access.
Remember to create a .gitignore file suitable for your project so you don't version unwanted files
Initiate a base deep-learning project to which you will implement and apply the methods and tools covered throughout the course
Add a model file and a training / test script and get that running (Recommended, but not mandatory: Consider writing your inference script in another language than Python e.g. C++)
Create a requirements.txt with whatever dependencies that you are using.
Remember to document essential parts of your code.
Remember to comply with good coding practices (PEP8) while doing the project
Setup version control for your data, or part of your data, and model - See MLOps cluster storage-server address in today's slides (Otherwise, you can get 5GB free Google Cloud storage (here) or AWS S3 cloud storage here)
Write one or multiple configuration files for your experiments
Load the configurations and manage your hyperparameters
Documentation

In addition to briefly discussing the relevant topics covered in this lecture and detailing how you've applied specific methods in your MLOps project (i.e., by solving the exercises above), your report must also include documentation of the following items.

D1.1: A short introduction to MLOps, its purpose, and the difference from existing development paradigms
D1.2: A short description of the selected project for which you will develop an MLOps pipeline.
D1.3: What challenges do you foresee for your specific project regarding development, reproducibility, monitoring, maintenance and etc. of the AI-system?
D1.4: A description of your model card, and a reference to the appendix where the final model card can be seen (For now, just draft an initial model card, and complete it as the course progresses).
